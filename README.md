# Sales Analysis(2 Year Report)
Problem Statement
- This project explores sales data over two years to answer business-critical questions such as:
1. What is the total sales amount?
2. How do sales vary by year, quarter, and month?
3. Which regions, countries, teams, and individuals perform best?
4. Which product categories and types drive the most sales?

Why This Analysis Matters
- This sales analysis provides valuable insights into business performance over a two-year period. By breaking down total sales by time (monthly, quarterly, yearly) and across different business dimensions (region, country, team,category, product type, and salesperson), the analysis helps identify trends, top performers, and areas of improvement.
-  These findings can support strategic decisions such as resource allocation, product focus, and sales team management.
-  It also lays a foundation for more advanced analysis like forecasting or campaign planning, making it a powerful tool for both operational and executive-level decision-making.
